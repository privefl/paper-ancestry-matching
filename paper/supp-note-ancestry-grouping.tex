\subsection*{Measures of genetic dissimilarity between populations}

We first compare four measures of genetic dissimilarity using populations of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G$^\dag$, \cite{10002015global}). 
The $F_{ST}$$^\dag$ is an ubiquitous measure of genetic dissimilarity between populations and the first measure we use in this comparison.
We report $F_{ST}$ between the 26 1000G populations in tables \ref{tab:fst-AFR}-\ref{tab:fst-SAS}, and the clustering of these populations based on $F_{ST}$ in figure \ref{fig:heatmap0}.
The other three measures compared are distances applied to the PC scores$^\dag$ of the genetic data: 1) the Bhattacharyya distance$^\dag$; 2) the distance between the centers (geometric medians$^\dag$) of the two populations; and 3) the shortest distance between pairs of PC scores, one from each of the two populations.
The (squared) Euclidean distance between population centers appears to be an appropriate PCA-based distance as it is approximately proportional to the $F_{ST}$ (Figure \ref{fig:compare-dist2}) and provides an appropriate clustering of populations (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap2}).
However, future work is needed to understand why residuals are bimodal for large distances (e.g.\ in figure \ref{fig:compare-dist2}).
This relation between $F_{ST}$ and (squared) Euclidean distances in the PCA space has been previously shown for two populations only \cite[]{mcvean2009genealogical}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{compare-Euclidean-to-Fst}}
	\caption{Comparing $F_{ST}$ to the squared Euclidean distance on the PCA space (i.e.\ using PC scores$^\dag$) between centers of pairs of the 26 1000G populations. \label{fig:compare-dist2}}
\end{figure}

Previously, we and others proposed to use (robust) Mahalanobis distances to infer ancestry or identify a single homogeneous group of individuals \cite[]{peterson2017utility,prive2020efficient}. 
When looking at distances between two populations, this corresponds to using the Bhattacharyya distance.
However, in contrast to Euclidean distances, the two other Bhattacharyya and shortest distances do not provide as satisfactory results (Figures \ref{fig:heatmap1}, \ref{fig:compare-dist1}, \ref{fig:heatmap3} and \ref{fig:compare-dist3}). 
For example, African Caribbeans in Barbados (ACB) and Americans of African Ancestry in SW USA (ASW) and the four admixed American (AMR) populations are close to all European (EUR), South Asian (SAS) and African (AFR) populations when using the Bhattacharyya distance (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap1}).
We hypothesize that the main issue with this approach is that an admixed population covers a large volume in the PCA space, therefore all distances to this population cluster are small because of the covariance component from the Mahalanobis distance.
In contrast, the global scale of the PC scores used when using Euclidean distances is invariant from the cluster scattering.

We also vary the number of PCs used for computing the Euclidean distances and how they compare with $F_{ST}$ in figure \ref{fig:compare-distK}.
With 2 to 4 PCs, we are able to adequately separate distant populations, but not the closest ones. For example, when using 4 PCs, there are pairs of populations with an $F_{ST}$ of \textasciitilde0.02 while their PC centers are superimposed (Figure \ref{fig:compare-distK}).
When using more PCs (8, 16 or 25) to compute the distances, results remain mostly similar.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{PCA-based ancestry inference}

We project the dataset of interest onto the PCA space of the 1000G data using the fast tools developed in \cite{prive2020efficient}.
We recall that this uses an automatic removal of LD when computing PCA and a correction for shrinkage in projected PC scores, which has been shown to be particularly important when using PC scores for ancestry estimation \cite[]{zhang2020fast}. 
Based on the results from the previous section, we propose to assign individual ancestry to one of the 26 1000G populations based on the Euclidean distance to these reference population centers in the PCA space (geometric medians$^\dag$ of PC scores$^\dag$). 
Since we showed previously that (squared) distances in the PCA space are proportional to $F_{ST}$, we can set a threshold on these distances that would correspond approximately to an $F_{ST}$ of e.g.\ 0.002. This threshold is close to the dissimilarity between Spanish and Italian people ($F_{ST}$(IBS, TSI) of 0.0015).
When an individual is not close enough to any of the 26 1000G populations, we leave its ancestry inference as unknown, otherwise we assign this individual to the closest reference population center.

We first perform ancestry estimation for the individuals in the UK Biobank$^\dag$.
For 488,371 individuals, this procedure takes less than 20 minutes using 16 cores.
These individuals seem to originate from many parts of the world when we project onto the PCA space of the 1000G (Figure \ref{fig:proj-UKBB}). 
Self-reported ancestry (Field 21000) is available for almost all individuals, with only 1.6\% with unknown or mixed ancestry.
When using the threshold defined before, we could not infer ancestry for 4.6\% of all 488,371 individuals.
More precisely, among ``British'', ``Irish'' and ``White'' ancestries, this represented respectively 2.2\%, 3.3\% and 7.9\% (Tables \ref{tab:infer-UKBB-superpop} and \ref{tab:ancestry-fine-pred}). This also represented 3.3\% for ``Chinese'', 13.8\% for ``Indian'' and 17.8\% for ``African'' ancestries. 
Finally, mixed ancestries were particularly difficult to match to any of the 1000G populations, e.g.\ 97.3\% unmatched within ``White and Black Africa'' and 93.0\% within ``White and Asian'' ancestries.
Only 47 individuals were misclassified in ``super'' population of the 1000G; e.g.\ six ``British'' were classified as South Asians, one ``Chinese'' as European and 25 ``Caribbean'' as South Asian by our method (Table \ref{tab:infer-UKBB-superpop}). 
However, when comparing the location of these mismatched individuals to the rest of individuals on the PCA space computed within the UK Biobank \cite[]{bycroft2017genome}, it seems more probable that our genetic ancestry estimate is exact while the self-reported ancestry is not matching the underlying genetic ancestry for these individuals (Figure \ref{fig:mismatch}).
This possible discrepancy between self-reported ancestry and genetic ancestry has been reported before \cite[]{mersha2015self}.

We also test the approach proposed in \cite{zhang2020fast} which consists in finding the 20 nearest neighbors in 1000G and computing the frequency of (super) population membership, weighted by the inverse distance to these 20 closest 1000G individuals. When this probability is less than 0.875, they leave the ancestry as unknown, aiming at discarding admixed individuals.
Less than 0.5\% could not be matched by their method (Table \ref{tab:ancestry-pred-kNN}).
Of note, they could match much more admixed individuals, whereas they set a high probability threshold aiming at discarding such admixed individuals. 
Morever, there are many more discrepancies between their method and the self-reported ancestry in the UK Biobank (Table \ref{tab:ancestry-pred-kNN}) compared to the previous results with our method (Table  \ref{tab:infer-UKBB-superpop}).
The global scale used in Euclidean distances makes it more robust to infer ancestry as compared to using relative proportions from k=20 nearest neighbors (kNN, \cite{zhang2020fast}).
Indeed, consider e.g.\ an admixed individual of say 25\% European ancestry and 75\% African ancestry.
The kNN-based method is likely to identify this individual as of African ancestry, while our method will probably be unable to match it, which is a beneficial feature when we are interested in defining genetically homogeneous groups.
We also believe our proposed method to be more robust than machine learning methods, because a machine learning method would try e.g.\ to differentiate between GBR and CEU 1000G populations, which are two very close populations of Northwest Europe ($F_{ST}$ of 0.0002). In other words, our distance-based method should benefit from the inclusion of any new reference population, whereas it would make it increasingly complex to apply machine learning methods.

Finally, our method is able to accurately differentiate between sub-continental populations such as differentiating between Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Chinese people (Table \ref{tab:ancestry-fine-pred}).
We also applied our ancestry detection technique to the European individuals of the POPRES data \cite[]{nelson2008population}. 
Only 16 out of the 1385 individuals (1.2\%) could not be matched, of which 11 were from East or South-East Europe (Table \ref{tab:ancestry-pred-popres}).
Note that all individuals that we could match were identified as of European ancestry. 
We could also identify accurately sub-regions of Europe; e.g.\ 261 out of 264 Spanish and Portugese individuals were identified as ``Iberian Population in Spain'' (EUR\_IBS, Table \ref{tab:ancestry-pred-popres}).

The proposed method has two possible limitations. 
First, since we match target individuals to 1000G populations, if individuals are far from all 26 1000G populations, then they would not be matched.
When looking at the POPRES data, more individuals from East Europe could not be matched. 
This is not surprising because there are no East European population in the 1000G data.
Moreover, if we look at the location of the 1000G populations on a map, we can see that it lacks representation of many parts of the world (Figure \ref{fig:map}).
This issue has also been reported e.g.\ for Asian populations \cite[]{lu2013principal}.
Therefore more diverse populations should be aggregated to better cover the worldwide genome diversity, such as with the Simons Genome Diversity Project \cite[]{mallick2016simons}, which would also improve the proposed method.
A second potential limitation of the proposed method is that it has two hyper-parameters: the number of PCs used to compute the distances and the threshold on the minimum distance to any cluster center above which the ancestry is not matched. 
Several studies have used only the first two PCs for ancestry inference. We have shown here that using two PCs (or even four) is not enough for distinguishing between populations at the sub-continental level (Figure \ref{fig:compare-distK}).
As in \cite{prive2020efficient}, we recommend to use all PCs that visually separate some populations.
Moreover, we believe our proposed method to be robust to increasing the number of PCs used because contribution to the Euclidean distance is smaller for later PCs than for first PCs.
As for the distance limit, we have shown here how to define it to approximately correspond to an $F_{ST}$ of 0.002. Alternatively, a threshold can be chosen based on the visual inspection of the histogram of distances (on a log scale).
This threshold can also be adjusted depending on how homogeneous one want each cluster to be.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection*{PCA-based ancestry grouping}

Finally, we show several ways how to use our ancestry inference method for grouping genetically homogeneous individuals.
One first possible approach is to simply match individuals that are close enough to one of the 1000G populations, as described previously.
Alternatively, one could use the internal PC scores and the self-reported ancestries or countries of birth, e.g.\ available in the UK Biobank (Fields 21000 and 20115). 
{\bf This solution does not require projecting individuals to the 1000G, but does require computing PC scores within the dataset instead.}
In the UK Biobank data, we can define centers of the seven self-reported ancestry groups: British, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Caribbean and African; then match all individuals to one of these centers (or none if an individual is far from all centers).
This enables e.g.\ to capture a larger set of individuals who are close enough to British people (e.g.\ Irish people), while discarding individuals whose genetic ancestry is not matching the self-reported ancestry (Table \ref{tab:ancestry-groups}). 
Only 3.7\% of all individuals could not be matched.
The resulting clusters are presented in the PCA space in figure \ref{fig:grouping}.

{\bf One could do the same using the countries of birth instead of the self-reported ancestries, which we use in the main text.}
Again, the country of birth may sometime not reflect the ancestral origin. Therefore, we first compute the robust centers (geometric medians) of all countries with at least 300 individuals. Then, we cluster these countries based on their distance in the PCA space to make sure of their validity as proxies for genetic ancestry and to choose a small subset of centers with good coverage of the overall dissimilarities (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap-country}).
Based on the previous clustering and the available sample sizes, we choose to use the centers from the following eight countries as reference: the United Kingdom, Poland, Iran, Italy, India, China, ``Caribbean'' and Nigeria.
Only 2.8\% of all individuals could not be matched to one of these eight groups (Table \ref{tab:country-groups}).
The resulting clusters are presented in the PCA space in figure \ref{fig:grouping2}.
Note that these clusters probably include individuals from nearby countries as well.
Moreover, more clusters could probably be defined, e.g.\ the individuals with large values for PC6 in figure \ref{fig:grouping2} seem to originate from South America with many people from Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, Brazil, and Argentina.
However, here we decide to restrict to large enough clusters (e.g.\ with more than 1000 individuals).
The cluster with small values for PC4 corresponds to Ashkenazi ancestry, and is described in the main text.

	\caption{The first eight PC scores$^\dag$ computed from the UK Biobank (Field 22009) colored by the homogeneous ancestry group we infer for these individuals. \label{fig:grouping2}}
\end{figure}

Finally, when we know that the data is composed of a predominant ancestry, we can define a single homogeneous cluster by simply restricting to individuals who are close enough to the overall center of all individuals (Figure \ref{fig:hist3}).
When doing so, we can cluster 91\% of the data into one cluster composed of 421,871 British, 12,039 Irish, 8351 ``Other White'', 1814 individuals of unknown ancestry, 467 ``White'' and 41 individuals of other self-reported ancestries.
This is made possible because we use the geometric median which is robust to outliers.

Note that the code used in this supplementary note is available at \url{https://github.com/privefl/paper-ancestry-matching/tree/master/code}.

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item The {\bf 1000 Genomes Project (1000G)} data is composed of approximately 100 individuals for each of 26 populations worldwide (described at \url{https://www.internationalgenome.org/category/population/}), including 7 African (AFR), 5 East Asian (EAS), 5 South Asian (SAS), 5 European (EUR) and 4 admixed American (AMR) populations.
	Here we used the transformed data in PLINK format provided in \cite{prive2020efficient}.
	
	\item The $\boldsymbol{F_{ST}}$ measures the relative amount of genetic variance between populations compared to the total genetic variance within these populations \cite[]{wright1965interpretation}.
	We use the weighted average formula proposed in \cite{weir1984estimating}, which we now implement in our package bigsnpr \cite[]{prive2017efficient}.
	
	\item The {\bf Principal Component (PC) scores} are defined as $U \Delta$, where $U \Delta V^T$ is the singular value decomposition of the (scaled) genotype matrix \cite[]{prive2020efficient}. They are usually truncated, e.g.\ corresponding to the first 20 principal dimensions only. 
	
	\item The {\bf Bhattacharyya distance} between two multivariate normal distributions $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu_1,\,\boldsymbol\Sigma_1)$ and $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu_2,\,\boldsymbol\Sigma_2)$ is defined as
	$D_B={1\over 8}(\boldsymbol\mu_2-\boldsymbol\mu_1)^T \boldsymbol\Sigma^{-1}(\boldsymbol\mu_2-\boldsymbol\mu_1)+{1\over 2}\log \,\left({|\boldsymbol\Sigma| \over \sqrt{|\boldsymbol\Sigma_1| \, |\boldsymbol\Sigma_2|} }\right)$,
	where $\boldsymbol\Sigma={\boldsymbol\Sigma_1+\boldsymbol\Sigma_2 \over 2}$ and $|M|$ is the absolute value of the determinant of matrix $M$ \cite[]{bhattacharyya1943measure,fukunaga1990introduction}. 
	The mean and covariance parameters for each population are computed using the robust location and covariance parameters as proposed in \cite{prive2020efficient}.
	
	\item The {\bf geometric median} of points is the point that minimizes the sum of all Euclidean distances to these points. We now implement this as function \texttt{geometric\_median} in our R package bigutilsr.
	
	\item The {\bf UK Biobank} is a large cohort of half a million individuals from the UK, for which we have access to both genotypes and multiple phenotypes (\url{https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/}).
	We apply some quality control filters to the genotyped data; we remove individuals with more than 10\% missing values, variants with more than 1\% missing values, variants having a minor allele frequency < 0.01, variants with P-value of the Hardy-Weinberg exact test < $10^{-50}$, and non-autosomal variants. 
	This results in 488,371 individuals and 504,139 genetic variants.
